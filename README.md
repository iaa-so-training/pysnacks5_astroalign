## PySnacks
Within the  Severo Ochoa Training Initiative of the IAA-CSIC we are offering short introductory practical courses about Python packages for astrophysical applications (PySnacks). We invite you to participate in the 1h course PySnacks 5: ASTROALIGN.

 
## Abstract
ASTROALIGN is a python module that can serve to align two astronomical images. It determines the solution  by finding similar 3-point asterisms (triangles) in both images and estimating the affine transformation between them. ASTROALIGN is particularly useful when there is no WCS information available or when the images to be aligned have been taken at different wavelengths and initial “by eye” alignment is very challenging. In this 1h workshop I will impart  a brief  introduction into the capabilities of ASTROALIGN and how to use it.
 
This course will be taught by Rainer Schödel.
